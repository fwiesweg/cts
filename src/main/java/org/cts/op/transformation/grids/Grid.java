/**
 * A grid is a data structure containing numeric data organized in rows and
 * columns. Cell 0,0 represents a real location x0, y0, and every cell has a
 * width (dx) and a height (dy) so that a cell at row i and column j represents
 * a location of coordinates
 * <ul>
 * <li>x = j*dx+x0</li>
 * <li>y = i*dy+y0</li>
 * </ul>
 * The main grid parameters are :
 * <ul>
 * <li>The number of columns (c) and rows (r) (with a total number of values in
 * the grid equals to c * r)</li>
 * <li>x0, y0, the real coordinates of the grid cell at column 0, row 0</li>
 * <li>gridWidth and gridHeight, which represent the real grid width and the
 * real grid height</li>
 * </ul>
 * Other derivative parameters are
 * <ul>
 * <li>dx = gridWidth/(column number -1)</li>
 * <li>dx = gridHeight/(row number -1)</li>
 * </ul>

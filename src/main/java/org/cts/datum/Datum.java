/*
 * Coordinate Transformations Suite (abridged CTS)  is a library developped to

 * Its main focus are simplicity, flexibility, interoperability, in this order.

 * This library has been originally developed by Michaël Michaud under the JGeod
 * name. It has been renamed CTS in 2009 and shared to the community from
 * the OrbisGIS code repository.

/**
 * A datum (plural datums) is a reference from which measurements are made.<p>
 * In surveying and geodesy, a datum is a reference point on the earth's surface
 * against which position measurements are made, and an associated model of the
 * shape of the earth for computing positions. Horizontal datums are used for
 * describing a point on the earth's surface, in latitude and longitude or
 * another coordinate system. Vertical datums are used to measure elevations or
 * underwater depths. In engineering and drafting, a datum is a reference point,
 * surface, or axis on an object against which measurements are made.
